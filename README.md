# Automatic_Car_Parking_System (IOT)
It is a system to display the number of slots remaining for parking in the parking lot using Arduino Board.

CASE:
We display empty parking slots on the screen, so that we don’t need to physically visit the parking lot to check availability so it is very simple but effective way of using IOT in our daily life.
